            <h3>Who are we?</h3>
            <p id="about-us-paragraph">The 20th Armoured Brigade Combat Team is an Arma 3 HARDCORE MilSim unit based off of the real British Army 
                formation of same name.  Our unit takes place in the current time, where we operate using current weaponry, 
                vehicles, and equipment of the British Armed Forces. Our primary role, armoured infantry, sees the infantry 
                sections fighting with and out of the FV510 Warrior IFV.  The current regiments are 5 RIFLES and C Sqn, Queen's 
                Royal Hussars. The Reserves are represented by 7 RIFLES.  
                <br><br>
                We utilise real world tactics employed by the British 
                Armed Forces to the best of our abilities, and conduct professional training and advancement courses to keep 
                everyone up to scratch on their drills and skills.  
                <br><br>
                In order to make the whole experience as realistic as possible 
                we have a team of developers working to create custom assets, uniforms and vehicles. We also have a number of 
                current and former service members of British and NATO Armed Forces providing a unique background and skillset 
                for the unit.  
                <br><br>
                We are in no way associated with the real 20th Armoured Brigade Combat Team, the British Army, or 
                the UK Ministry of Defence.

        <h3>FAQ's</h3>
        <p>
        <b>Question:</b> May I be apart of another unit or community?
        <br>
        <b>Answer:</b> Yes, we do not have any dual-clanning restrictions. IF you are apart of another unit or 
        community, you must be able to attend our weekly events on a regular basis.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Question:</b> Are you a serious MilSim?
        <br>
        <b>Answer:</b> We take operations and trainings seriously in that we expect full effort and focus throughout.
        We can take a joke and we all have a laugh in ops, but we do expect our members to know when it is time to 
        mess around and when it is time to go serious.  We WILL NOT expect you to address anybody by Rank or Billet, 
        but we do expect you to listen to anyone who has been put into a superior position than yourself.  We do no 
        mess around with the bullshit aspect of the military (Such as parades) and are focused entirely on replicating 
        the british army in terms of combat and structure only
